## Hackathon Objectives
Tasks are going to be tracked via the project
- [ ] Investigation of delay patterns
    - [ ] Which airlines are most punctual?
    - [ ] Which airports are operated with little delays?
    - [ ] Which equipment types (aircrafts) cause delays?
- [ ] Are there existing correlations between the variables? e.g.
    - [ ] Which hubs do have short passenger handling times?
    - [ ] Correlation aircraft-delay per airport
    - [ ] Different flight times for airlines on similar routes
