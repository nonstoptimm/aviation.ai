## Hackathon Objectives
Tasks are going to be tracked via the project
- [X] Investigation of delay patterns
    - [X] Which airlines are most punctual?
    - [ ] Which airports are operated with little delays?
    - [X] Which equipment types (aircrafts) cause delays?
- [X] Are there existing correlations between the variables? e.g.
    - [ ] Which hubs do have short passenger handling times?
    - [X] Correlation aircraft-delay per airport
    - [X] Different flight times for airlines on similar routes
